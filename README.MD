In this repository we present a TBB agent based simulation of the property market.

The Blockchain based solution for collection of bids from buyers brings transparency to the property market and hence provides new level of market efficiency (reducing the level of fraud, provides a better matching of buyers to sellers and avoid situations of price manipulation).  Currently, in the property market, there is an information asymmetry between the buyers and sellers versus buying and selling agents. In particular, neither buyer nor the seller know whether their respective agent is acting in their best interest given they do not have easy access to the bids. All the bids are presented to the seller through their agent.
